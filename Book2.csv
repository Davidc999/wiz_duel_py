Magic mirror,cw,,Personal status effect,True,False,False,Cast early and apply as a one-turn personal status effect,2,gestures C-(w. Any spell cast on a subject protected by this spell is reflected back upon the caster of that spell. The magic mirror protects only during the turn in which it was cast. The protection includes spells like missile and lightning bolt but does not include attacks by monsters or stabs from wizards. The mirror does not affect spells which are cast upon oneself (e.g. spells from this section and the Summonning section). The mirror is countered totally if either a counter-spell or dispel magic are cast on the subject in the same turn as the mirror. The mirror has no effect on spells which affect more than one person (such as fire storm). Two mirrors cast at one subject simultaneously combine to form a single mirror.

Terminates the effects of all Enchantment Spells that have been cast on the subject including those that are cast on the subject at the same time as the remove enchantment. Effects which have already passed are not reversed. For example, the victim of a blindness spell would not be able to see what their opponent's gestures were on the the blindness is removed. Note that all enchantments are removed and the caster may not pick and choose. Remove enchantment also destroys any monster upon which it is cast, although the monster can attack in that turn. Wizards suffer no adverse effects from this spell, aside from the removal of their enchantments."

In the case of blanket spells, which affect more than one person, the subject of the counter-spell alone is protected. For example, a fire storm spell could kill off a monster but not if a counter-spell were cast on the monster in the same turn. Everyone else would be affected as usual by the fire storm unless they had their own protection. The counter-spell will cancel all the spells cast at the subject for that turn (including remove enchantment and magic mirror) except dispel magic and finger of death. It will combine with another spell of its own type for the same effect as if it were alone. The counter-spell will also act as a shield on the final gesture in addition to its other properties, but the shield effect is on the same subject as its other effect."
